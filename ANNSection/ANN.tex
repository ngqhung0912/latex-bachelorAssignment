In order to choose a correct NN model that can describes the relationship of micro- and macroparameters as indicated in the contact law, a "bottom-up" method is employed. Initially, a simple one-input one-output NN will be built, to assess how many layers (and neurons) it would take to learn a quadratic relationship \(y = x^2\), and inverse relationship \(y = 1/x\).

In the next step, a slightly more complex problem is analysed: a 4-D input and 4-D output model, with contact laws described in table xxx. Finally, a fully-functional model will be coupled with DEM simulations from MercuryDPM.   

Certain reccomendations will also be taken into account, (7 and 15? )
