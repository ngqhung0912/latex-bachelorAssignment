	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {The Discrete Element Method (DEM) requires input parameters to be calibrated and validated in order to accurately model the physical process being simulated. This is typically achieved through experiments that examine the macroscopic behavior of particles, however, it is often difficult to efficiently and accurately obtain a representative parameter set. In this study, a method is presented to identify and select a set of DEM input parameters by applying a backpropagation (BP) neural network to establish the non-linear relationship between dynamic macroscopic particle properties and DEM parameters. Once developed and trained, the BP neural network provides an efficient and accurate method to select the DEM parameter set. The BP neural network can be developed and trained for one or more laboratory calibration experiments, and be applied to a wide range of bulk materials under dynamic flow conditions.},

	abstract = {Powders are a special class of granular matter due to the important role of cohesive forces. Because the flow behavior of powders depends on both their flow states and confining stresses, it is difficult to measure/quantify with only one experiment. In this study, the most commonly used characterization tests that cover a wide range of states are compared: (static, free surface) angle of repose, the (quasi-static, confined) ring shear steady state angle of internal friction, and the (dynamic, free surface) rotating drum flow angle are considered for free flowing, moderately and strongly cohesive limestone powders. The free flowing powder gives good agreement of angles among all different situations (devices), while the moderately and strongly cohesive powders behave more interestingly. Starting from the flow angle in the rotating drum and going slower, one can extrapolate to the limit of zero rotation rate, but then observes that the angle of repose measured from the static heap is considerably larger, possibly due to its special history. When we stretch the ring shear test to its lowest confining stress limit, the steady state angle of internal friction of the cohesive powder becomes comparable with the flow angle (at free surface) in the zero rotation rate limit of the rotating drum test, by defining an appropriate effective stress.},

	abstract = { The distinct element method is a numerical model capable of describing the mechanical behaviour of assemblies of discs and spheres. The method is based on the use of an explicit numerical scheme in which the interaction of the particles is monitored contact by contact and the motion of the particles modelled particle by particle. The main features of the distinct element method are described. The method is validated by comparing force vector plots obtained from the computer program BALL with the corresponding plots obtained from a photoelastic analysis. The photoelastic analysis used for the comparison is the one applied to an assembly of discs by De Josselin de Jong and Verruijt (1969). The force vector diagrams obtained numerically closely resemble those obtained photoelastically. It is concluded from this comparison that the distinct element method and the program BALL are valid tools for research into the behaviour of granular assemblies.

@article{DERAKHSHANI2015127,
	abstract = {The ability to accurately simulate the realistic behavior of granular materials is one of the challenging issues of the numerical techniques. The first purpose of this study is to calibrate the microscopic properties of granular materials by Discrete Element Method (DEM). Coefficients of rolling and sliding friction as two main microscopic properties of granular material have a significant effect on the amount of macroscopic properties like Angle of Repose (AoR). Earlier studies indicated that the same AoR can be demonstrated by different combinations of the microscopic properties of materials. Therefore the AoR cannot singly be considered as a reliable criterion for DEM calibration, hence time as the second macroscopic property was considered along with the AoR for the calibration of microscopic properties. Furthermore, the need for further study in the field of fine particles led to the use of quartz sand with the diameter in the range of 300 to 600μm in this study. It was assumed that the sand grains are spherical particles and dry material (non-cohesive). In the first step of the calibration process, the Sandglass test was performed to measure the macroscopic properties of quartz sand. Then the Sandglass was simulated by DEM for a varied range of coefficients of rolling and sliding friction. A comparison between the AoR and discharging time of materials and DEM results indicated that the coefficients of rolling and sliding friction of sand particles are 0.3 and 0.52 respectively. The calibrated model was verified by performing a comparison between the experimental and simulation results of the conical pile test. The second purpose of this research is to decrease the computational time of DEM simulation through utilizing a slice of a domain instead of the whole domain where the material slice represents the realistic mechanical behavior of materials. Therefore, a rectangular container was experimentally tested and numerically simulated at different thicknesses of the container. Both experimental and numerical results indicated that the critical thickness of the cabin is 32 times of the particle diameter at which the front and rear walls of the cabin do not restrict the mobility of particles in the median plane. In addition, when the wall boundary condition was replaced by periodic boundary condition, the critical thickness decreased to 4 times of particle diameter which significantly improved the computational speed.},

	abstract = {The discrete element method is a method for simulation of a particle system. For the ``soft-sphere'' mechanism of particle interactions, there are several models for normal contact forces, namely linear spring--dashpot, and non-linear damped Hertzian spring--dashpot, among others. The focus of this paper is to determine the normal spring stiffness coefficient of the linear model through the numerical solution for the overlap between particles in non-linear models. The linear spring stiffness is determined using equivalence between the linear and the nonlinear models. Using the MFIX computational code, the proposed approach is applied in the numerical simulations of two problems: single freely falling particle and bubbling fluidized bed. A method based on mean dimensionless overlap is suggested as an initial estimate to determine the normal spring stiffness coefficient. Other possible methods for computing the stiffness coefficient are also discussed in this work, e.g., maximum dimensionless overlap and dimensionless contact duration.},

	abstract = {Gabions are steel mesh cages filled with stones. Recently, they have had a great diffusion for numerous applications such as erosion control and soil retention along cuts and natural slopes. The study of their mechanical behaviour under different loading conditions is a fundamental prerequisite for an improved understanding of their overall performance and in a design perspective. In this respect, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) appears a robust and effective technique. The DEM is particularly suited for modelling granular materials, and recently it has efficiently been applied for modelling deformable structures such as welded meshes. This work presents a discrete framework for the modelling of rock-filled gabions. The gabion module is modelled as an assembly of deformable cylindrical elements, while the filling material is represented using rigid aggregates of spherical particles. The tensile behaviour of the gabion elements is set in order to fit the mechanical response of the steel bars adopted in practice. The model is applied to analyse a uniaxial compression test on a single gabion.},

In this work, the usage of artificial neural networks in combination with numerical simulations using coarse-grained shapes to obtain the material contact parameters that replicate the behavior of particles of complex shapes is proposed. Dynamic angle of repose and void fraction are input parameters for the training of an artificial neural network using static and rolling friction as output parameters. The frictional parameters are combined with a coarse-grained shape and successfully replicate the experimental static angle of repose obtained for octahedral and cubic shape particles. The static angle of repose is not involved in the training process.

@article{NN-GA,
	abstract = {The discrete element method (DEM) is commonly used to study various powders in motion during transportation, screening, mixing, etc.; this requires several microscopic parameters to characterize the complex mechanical behavior of the particles. Herein, a new discrete element parameter calibration method is proposed to calibrate the ultrafine agglomerated powder (recycled polyurethane powder). Optimal Latin hypercube sampling and virtual simulation experiments were conducted using the commercial DEM software; the microscopic variables included the static friction coefficient between the particles, collision recovery coefficient, Johnson&ndash;Kendall&ndash;Roberts surface energy, static friction coefficient between the particles and wall, and collision recovery coefficient. A predictive model based on genetic-algorithm-optimized feedforward neural network (back propagation) was developed to calibrate the microscopic DEM simulation parameters. The cycle search algorithm and mean-shift cluster analysis were used to confirm the input parameters&rsquo; range by comparing the mean value of the dynamic angle of repose measured via the batch accumulation test. These parameters were verified by the baffle lifting method and the rotating drum method. This calibration method, once successfully developed, will be suitable for use in a variety of fine viscous powder dynamic flow conditions.},

@article{MercuryDPM,
	abstract = {We introduce the open-source package MercuryDPM, which we have been developing over the last few years. MercuryDPM is a code for discrete particle simulations. It simulates the motion of particles by applying forces and torques that stem either from external body forces, (gravity, magnetic fields, etc.) or particle interactions. The code has been developed extensively for granular applications, and in this case these are typically (elastic, plastic, viscous, frictional) contact forces or (adhesive) short-range forces. However, it could be adapted to include long-range (molecular, self-gravity) interactions as well. MercuryDPM is an object-oriented algorithm with an easy-to-use user interface and a flexible core, allowing developers to quickly add new features. It is parallelised using MPI and released under the BSD 3-clause licence. Its open-source developers' community has developed many features, including moving and curved walls; state-of-the-art granular contact models; specialised classes for common geometries; non-spherical particles; general interfaces; restarting; visualisation; a large self-test suite; extensive documentation; and numerous tutorials and demos. In addition, MercuryDPM has three major components that were originally invented and developed by its team: an advanced contact detection method, which allows for the first time large simulations with wide size distributions; curved (non-triangulated) walls; and multicomponent, spatial and temporal coarse-graining, a novel way to extract continuum fields from discrete particle systems. We illustrate these tools and a selection of other MercuryDPM features via various applications, including size-driven segregation down inclined planes, rotating drums, and dosing silos.
Program summary
Program Title: MercuryDPM Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/n7jmdrdc52.1 Licensing provisions: BSD 3-Clause Programming language: C++, Fortran Supplementary material: http://mercurydpm.org Nature of problem: Simulation of granular materials, i.e. conglomerations of discrete, macroscopic particles. The interaction between individual grains is characterised by a loss of energy, making the behaviour of granular materials distinct from atomistic materials, i.e. solids, liquids and gases. Solution method: MercuryDPM (Thornton et al., 2013, 2019; Weinhart et al., 2016, 2017, 2019) is an implementation of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM), also known as the Discrete Element Method (DEM) (Cundall and Strack, 1979). It simulates the motion of individual particles by applying forces and torques that stem either from external forces (gravity, magnetic fields, etc.) or from particle-pair and particle--wall interactions (typically elastic, plastic, dissipative, frictional, and adhesive contact forces). DPM simulations have been successfully used to understand the many unique granular phenomena -- sudden phase transitions, jamming, force localisation, etc. -- that cannot be explained without considering the granular microstructure. Unusual features: MercuryDPM was designed ab initio with the aim of allowing the simulation of realistic geometries and materials found in industrial and geotechnical applications. It thus contains several bespoke features invented by the MercuryDPM team: (i) a neighbourhood detection algorithm (Krijgsman et al., 2014) that can efficiently simulate highly polydisperse packings, which are common in industry; (ii) curved walls (Weinhart et al., 2016) making it possible to model real industrial geometries exactly, without triangulation errors; and (iii) MercuryCG (Weinhart et al., 2012, 2013, 2016; Tunuguntla et al., 2016), a state-of-the-art analysis tool that extracts local continuum fields, providing accurate analytical/rheological information often not available from experiments or pilot plants. It further contains a large range of contact models to simulate complex interactions such as elasto-plastic deformation (Luding, 2008), sintering (Fuchs et al., 2017), melting (Weinhart et al., 2019), breaking, wet and dry cohesion (Roy et al., 2016, 2017), and liquid migration (Roy et al., 2018), all of which have important industrial applications.},

@article{nn-calibration,
	abstract = {In Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, particle--particle contact laws determine the macroscopic simulation results. Particle-based contact laws, in turn, commonly rely on semi-empirical parameters which are difficult to obtain by direct microscopic measurements. In this study, we present a method for the identification of DEM simulation parameters that uses artificial neural networks to link macroscopic experimental results to microscopic numerical parameters. In the first step, a series of DEM simulations with varying simulation parameters is used to train a feed-forward artificial neural network by backward-propagation reinforcement. In the second step, this artificial neural network is used to predict the macroscopic ensemble behaviour in relation to additional sets of particle-based simulation parameters. Thus, a comprehensive database is obtained which links particle-based simulation parameters to specific macroscopic bulk behaviours of the ensemble. The trained artificial neural network is able to predict the behaviours of additional sets of input parameters accurately and highly efficiently. Furthermore, this method can be used generically to identify DEM material parameters. For each set of calibration experiments, the neural network needs to be trained only once. After the training, the neural network provides a generic link between the macroscopic experimental results and the microscopic DEM simulation parameters. Based on these experiments, the DEM simulation parameters of any given non-cohesive granular material can be identified.},

@article{ga-calibration,
	abstract = {In this research, a universal framework for automated calibration of microscopic properties of modeled granular materials is proposed. The proposed framework aims at industrial scale applications, where optimization of the computational time step is important. It can be generally applied to all types of DEM simulation setups. It consists of three phases: data base generation, parameter optimization, and verification. In the first phase, DEM simulations are carried out on a multi-dimensional grid of sampled input parameter values to generate a database of macroscopic material responses. The database and experimental data are then used to interpolate the objective functions with respect to an arbitrary set of parameters. In the second phase, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve the calibration multi-objective optimization problem. In the third phase, the DEM simulations using the results of the calibrated input parameters are carried out to calculate the macroscopic responses that are then compared with experimental measurements for verification and validation. The proposed calibration framework has been successfully demonstrated by a case study with two-objective optimization for the model accuracy and the simulation time. Based on the concept of Pareto dominance, the trade-off between these two conflicting objectives becomes apparent. Through verification and validation steps, the approach has proven to be successful for accurate calibration of material parameters with the optimal simulation time.},

@inbook{introGranular,
	abstract = {A granular material can be defined as any material composed of many individual solid particles, irrespective of the particle size. Thus the term granular material embraces a wide variety of materials from the coarsest colliery rubble to the finest icing sugar. The handling of granular materials is of the greatest importance in the chemical industry, it being estimated that on a weight basis, roughly one-half of the products and at least three-quarters of the raw materials are in the form of granular solids. When one adds to this the vast tonnages of wheat, sugar, iron ore, cement, sand and gravel that have to be stored and transported, the importance of granular materials becomes selfevident. The early dominance of oil in the history of the chemical industry has tended to emphasize the importance of fluid mechanics as one of the main constituents of a chemical engineer's education. It is only relatively recently that the economic advantage of a study of the behaviour of granular materials has been appreciated. One reason for this is that solids handling equipment has long been designed empirically and it is only over the last thirty years that the subject has been placed on a firm numerical basis. By contrast, the quantitative nature of fluid mechanics has been well-known since the work of Darcy in the 1840's.Granular materials, or bulk solids as they are sometimes called, are usually stored in hoppers or bunkers.},

@article{grainLearning,
	abstract = {The calibration of discrete element method (DEM) simulations is typically accomplished in a trial-and-error manner. It generally lacks objectivity and is filled with uncertainties. To deal with these issues, the sequential quasi-Monte Carlo (SQMC) filter is employed as a novel approach to calibrating the DEM models of granular materials. Within the sequential Bayesian framework, the posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of micromechanical parameters, conditioned to the experimentally obtained stress--strain behavior of granular soils, are approximated by independent model trajectories. In this work, two different contact laws are employed in DEM simulations and a granular soil specimen is modeled as polydisperse packing using various numbers of spherical grains. Knowing the evolution of physical states of the material, the proposed probabilistic calibration method can recursively update the posterior PDFs in a five-dimensional parameter space based on the Bayes'rule. Both the identified parameters and posterior PDFs are analyzed to understand the effect of grain configuration and loading conditions. Numerical predictions using parameter sets with the highest posterior probabilities agree well with the experimental results. The advantage of the SQMC filter lies in the estimation of posterior PDFs, from which the robustness of the selected contact laws, the uncertainties of the micromechanical parameters and their interactions are all analyzed. The micro--macro correlations, which are byproducts of the probabilistic calibration, are extracted to provide insights into the multiscale mechanics of dense granular materials.},
