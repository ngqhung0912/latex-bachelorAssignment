@article{nn-calibration,
	abstract = {In Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, particle--particle contact laws determine the macroscopic simulation results. Particle-based contact laws, in turn, commonly rely on semi-empirical parameters which are difficult to obtain by direct microscopic measurements. In this study, we present a method for the identification of DEM simulation parameters that uses artificial neural networks to link macroscopic experimental results to microscopic numerical parameters. In the first step, a series of DEM simulations with varying simulation parameters is used to train a feed-forward artificial neural network by backward-propagation reinforcement. In the second step, this artificial neural network is used to predict the macroscopic ensemble behaviour in relation to additional sets of particle-based simulation parameters. Thus, a comprehensive database is obtained which links particle-based simulation parameters to specific macroscopic bulk behaviours of the ensemble. The trained artificial neural network is able to predict the behaviours of additional sets of input parameters accurately and highly efficiently. Furthermore, this method can be used generically to identify DEM material parameters. For each set of calibration experiments, the neural network needs to be trained only once. After the training, the neural network provides a generic link between the macroscopic experimental results and the microscopic DEM simulation parameters. Based on these experiments, the DEM simulation parameters of any given non-cohesive granular material can be identified.},

@article{ga-calibration,
	abstract = {In this research, a universal framework for automated calibration of microscopic properties of modeled granular materials is proposed. The proposed framework aims at industrial scale applications, where optimization of the computational time step is important. It can be generally applied to all types of DEM simulation setups. It consists of three phases: data base generation, parameter optimization, and verification. In the first phase, DEM simulations are carried out on a multi-dimensional grid of sampled input parameter values to generate a database of macroscopic material responses. The database and experimental data are then used to interpolate the objective functions with respect to an arbitrary set of parameters. In the second phase, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve the calibration multi-objective optimization problem. In the third phase, the DEM simulations using the results of the calibrated input parameters are carried out to calculate the macroscopic responses that are then compared with experimental measurements for verification and validation. The proposed calibration framework has been successfully demonstrated by a case study with two-objective optimization for the model accuracy and the simulation time. Based on the concept of Pareto dominance, the trade-off between these two conflicting objectives becomes apparent. Through verification and validation steps, the approach has proven to be successful for accurate calibration of material parameters with the optimal simulation time.},

@inbook{introGranular,
	abstract = {A granular material can be defined as any material composed of many individual solid particles, irrespective of the particle size. Thus the term granular material embraces a wide variety of materials from the coarsest colliery rubble to the finest icing sugar. The handling of granular materials is of the greatest importance in the chemical industry, it being estimated that on a weight basis, roughly one-half of the products and at least three-quarters of the raw materials are in the form of granular solids. When one adds to this the vast tonnages of wheat, sugar, iron ore, cement, sand and gravel that have to be stored and transported, the importance of granular materials becomes selfevident. The early dominance of oil in the history of the chemical industry has tended to emphasize the importance of fluid mechanics as one of the main constituents of a chemical engineer's education. It is only relatively recently that the economic advantage of a study of the behaviour of granular materials has been appreciated. One reason for this is that solids handling equipment has long been designed empirically and it is only over the last thirty years that the subject has been placed on a firm numerical basis. By contrast, the quantitative nature of fluid mechanics has been well-known since the work of Darcy in the 1840's.Granular materials, or bulk solids as they are sometimes called, are usually stored in hoppers or bunkers.},

@article{grainLearning,
	abstract = {The calibration of discrete element method (DEM) simulations is typically accomplished in a trial-and-error manner. It generally lacks objectivity and is filled with uncertainties. To deal with these issues, the sequential quasi-Monte Carlo (SQMC) filter is employed as a novel approach to calibrating the DEM models of granular materials. Within the sequential Bayesian framework, the posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of micromechanical parameters, conditioned to the experimentally obtained stress--strain behavior of granular soils, are approximated by independent model trajectories. In this work, two different contact laws are employed in DEM simulations and a granular soil specimen is modeled as polydisperse packing using various numbers of spherical grains. Knowing the evolution of physical states of the material, the proposed probabilistic calibration method can recursively update the posterior PDFs in a five-dimensional parameter space based on the Bayes'rule. Both the identified parameters and posterior PDFs are analyzed to understand the effect of grain configuration and loading conditions. Numerical predictions using parameter sets with the highest posterior probabilities agree well with the experimental results. The advantage of the SQMC filter lies in the estimation of posterior PDFs, from which the robustness of the selected contact laws, the uncertainties of the micromechanical parameters and their interactions are all analyzed. The micro--macro correlations, which are byproducts of the probabilistic calibration, are extracted to provide insights into the multiscale mechanics of dense granular materials.},
