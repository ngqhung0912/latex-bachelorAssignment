	abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of hydraulic fracturing models developed and applied to simulation of complex fractures in naturally fractured shale reservoirs. It discusses the technical challenges involved in modeling complex hydraulic fracture networks, the interaction between a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture, and various models and modeling approaches developed to simulate hydraulic fracture--natural fracture interaction, as well as the induced large scale complex fractures during fracturing treatments.},

@inbook{introGranular,
	abstract = {A granular material can be defined as any material composed of many individual solid particles, irrespective of the particle size. Thus the term granular material embraces a wide variety of materials from the coarsest colliery rubble to the finest icing sugar. The handling of granular materials is of the greatest importance in the chemical industry, it being estimated that on a weight basis, roughly one-half of the products and at least three-quarters of the raw materials are in the form of granular solids. When one adds to this the vast tonnages of wheat, sugar, iron ore, cement, sand and gravel that have to be stored and transported, the importance of granular materials becomes selfevident. The early dominance of oil in the history of the chemical industry has tended to emphasize the importance of fluid mechanics as one of the main constituents of a chemical engineer's education. It is only relatively recently that the economic advantage of a study of the behaviour of granular materials has been appreciated. One reason for this is that solids handling equipment has long been designed empirically and it is only over the last thirty years that the subject has been placed on a firm numerical basis. By contrast, the quantitative nature of fluid mechanics has been well-known since the work of Darcy in the 1840's.Granular materials, or bulk solids as they are sometimes called, are usually stored in hoppers or bunkers.},

@article{grainLearning,
	abstract = {The calibration of discrete element method (DEM) simulations is typically accomplished in a trial-and-error manner. It generally lacks objectivity and is filled with uncertainties. To deal with these issues, the sequential quasi-Monte Carlo (SQMC) filter is employed as a novel approach to calibrating the DEM models of granular materials. Within the sequential Bayesian framework, the posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of micromechanical parameters, conditioned to the experimentally obtained stress--strain behavior of granular soils, are approximated by independent model trajectories. In this work, two different contact laws are employed in DEM simulations and a granular soil specimen is modeled as polydisperse packing using various numbers of spherical grains. Knowing the evolution of physical states of the material, the proposed probabilistic calibration method can recursively update the posterior PDFs in a five-dimensional parameter space based on the Bayes'rule. Both the identified parameters and posterior PDFs are analyzed to understand the effect of grain configuration and loading conditions. Numerical predictions using parameter sets with the highest posterior probabilities agree well with the experimental results. The advantage of the SQMC filter lies in the estimation of posterior PDFs, from which the robustness of the selected contact laws, the uncertainties of the micromechanical parameters and their interactions are all analyzed. The micro--macro correlations, which are byproducts of the probabilistic calibration, are extracted to provide insights into the multiscale mechanics of dense granular materials.},
