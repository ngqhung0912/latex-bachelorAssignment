\subsubsection{Material properties} \label{section:MatProp}
The material chosen in this experiment is quartz sand, with experimental data provided by Derakhshani et al. \cite{DERAKHSHANI2015127}. There is no specific intrest regarding the choice of material; quartz sand is chosen due to the availability of data and the similarity of measurements.

        Particle Diameter (Âµm) & Cumulative Distribution (\%) \\ \hline
        300                    & 6.21                         \\
        425                    & 24.50                          \\

Among with the particle size distribution (PSD) given in Table \ref{table:PSDQuartzSand}, the fixed parameters in DEM simulations are density $\rho = 2653 kg/m^3$, and collision time $\Delta_t = 6.8 * 10^{-5}$. Static AoR of quartz sand measured by Derakhshani et al. is $33^{\circ}$.


\subsubsection{Heap simulation}



A heap simulation setup consists of two main part: A flat bottom panel and a cylinder, both represented by class \texttt{AxisymmetricIntersectionOfWalls}.
